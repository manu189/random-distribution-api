# random-distribution-api

I moved to Italy a few months ago, so I created this simple app to solve the distribution of trash disposal, and then I added a movie selector for more fun!

The app is now deployed on render.com

You can go to [https://random-distribution-api.onrender.com/basura](https://random-distribution-api.onrender.com/basura) to see our on trash disposal distribution.

Also, you can use the app to pick a movie for you from IMDB's top 250 movies: [https://random-distribution-api.onrender.com/hoySeVe](https://random-distribution-api.onrender.com/hoySeVe) 

This last one uses scraping to get the data, so it is always updated.
